        <p>
            A <a href="index.html">supernova remnant</a> in the constellation Taurus.
            Unlike a shell or <a href="IC_443.html">composite</a> type, it does not have
            a clear shell of material, beign mostly filamentary strands around the center.
            As the prototypical crab-type supernova remnant, it displays the following 
            properties:
