            The humanities are a set of subjects that study the human world and 
            human societies. Covering a range of topics from jornalism to history
            to philosophy, the huamnities are important to understand the cultural
            and human side of the world, rather than the more physical focused 
            STEM. However, many subjects in the humanities have a more physical
            side to them. The theorectical and physical humanities are contrasted below.
